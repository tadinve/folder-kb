a. The Contractor must submit a 'Particle Size Distribution Test Report' or
approved equal material gradation report to ensure the sand samples
submitted for testing are the same material approved for the EPIC
system.
b. If the sample varies and is not acceptable to Owner’s Representative
the Contractor must follow the steps under Section 1.03.E.
D. If the Contractor chooses a different sand and/or aggregate source from what is already
approved they must have the material samples tested prior to the bid due date as outlined in

washed 1⁄4” minus bridging aggregate meeting the general specifications for ASTM
C33-03 (Table 2 Grading Requirements for Coarse Aggregates, Size No. 89),
Standard Specifications for Concrete Aggregates. This material shall be tested by
the EPIC Testing Agent at the Contractor's expense.
2. The imported sand layer: Refer to EPIC recommendations for “Choosing the Right
Sand” and “EPIC Sand Testing Procedure” as preliminary screening tools. Submit a
two (2) gallon sample of medium washed sand meeting the general specifications for
ASTM F2396-04, Standard Guide for Construction of High Performance Sand-Based
Rootzones for Sports Fields. The imported sand layer shall also meet the
specifications detailed by EPIC in regards to particle size, capillary draw, compaction
and drainage characteristics. This material shall be tested by the EPIC Testing
Agent at the Contractor's expense. This testing shall determine the minimum EPIC
system profile height, the proper operating profile height and if any soil amendments
are necessary.
3. The test results of the sand and aggregate shall be reviewed by the Owner

1.0 INTRODUCTION
Langan Engineering and Environmental Services, Inc. (Langan) has prepared this Soil
Management Plan (SMP) on behalf of OAC Services Inc. (the Client), in support of the
Microsoft Campus redevelopment project located at 1045, 1055, 1065, 1075, and 1085 (1045-
1085) La Avenida Street (site) in Mountain View, California (Figure 1). This SMP presents a
summary of the proposed redevelopment project, a brief site history, and soil management
practices and procedures to be employed during site redevelopment. Soil management
practices and procedures are based on the results of environmental investigations conducted at
the site between January 2015 and June 2017.
The purpose of this SMP is to describe site conditions associated with past property use and
specifically proposed excavation activities to mitigate soil impacts currently present in the
subsurface at the site. The SMP also describes measures that will be implemented during
development activities to mitigate potential risks to the environment and to protect on-site
construction workers and/or pedestrians, site visitors, and off-site receptors from potential
exposure to hazardous substances present at the site. Site development activities related to
soil impacts may include, but are not limited to, shoring, soil excavation and off-site disposal,
and soil handling and grading activities.
Current development plans for the site include a combination of renovations of existing building
and new construction. Buildings 2 and 5 will remain with minor structural modifications and no
additional loads on the footings. Building 1, 3, and 4 will be demolished. New improvements
include a 2-story office building in the middle of the site, a 1- to 2-story conference center in the
northwest part of the site, a 2-story technology center in the northeast part of the site, a 3-story
post-tensioned concrete parking garage in the southeast part of the site, new entry roadway,
site flatwork, and landscaping. A maximum excavation depth of approximately three feet is
expected at the site. A site plan showing the existing buildings and the proposed limits of new
buildings at the site is provided as Figure 2.
