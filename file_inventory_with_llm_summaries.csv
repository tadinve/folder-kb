The drawing focuses on the layout and specifications for various electrical and structural installations, particularly concerning parking count systems and camera mounting setups.

Key topics include the installation of RSA boxes from a parking count system manufacturer, which are to be mounted low on concrete walls. These boxes require a 120V power supply. The document specifies the installation of 4-foot-tall, 4-inch diameter painted bollards for camera mounting, with details provided in separate drawings (referred to as ""SLD for details""). Each bollard is to be connected to the RSA box via a 1-inch conduit, ensuring a secure and functional setup for the parking count system.

The drawing also details the provision of light fixtures, which are indicated for location purposes only, and the installation of concrete site walls. Several conduits are mentioned, including existing and new ones, with specific dimensions and alignments provided. The document specifies the use of overhead conduits, including a 110V conduit, which is part of the electrical infrastructure.

Additionally, the document describes the construction of a Unistrut panel support system. This system includes a double P1000 galvanized Unistrut vertical post on a P2942 base, painted black, and secured with Hilti zinc-plated steel Kwik Bolt TZ expansion anchor bolts. The Unistrut frame supports a door panel with 5-inch stainless steel long throw hinges connected to a galvanized plate, bolted to the frame. The door panel features a 1x2 horizontal redwood slat screen with stainless steel finish head screws, providing both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The document includes information about the project's management and approval process, listing various dates for permit set submissions, plan checks, and addendums. The design team comprises architects and engineers, with specific roles such as project manager, development manager, and security manager identified. The project is managed by WRNS Studio, with contact information provided for further inquiries.

It involves key personnel from WRNS Studio and Rudolph and Sletten, including Scott Gillespie, Stephanie Hayos, and Stewart Green, with their respective contact information provided. The document outlines additional design and construction requirements for a project, specifically focusing on security enhancements and lighting revisions.

The primary purpose of this SI is to provide detailed instructions for the installation of additional fencing around the BW system Orenco tanks and enclosures. This includes the construction of enclosures with swing doors for lift station pump disconnects, as requested by the Building Inspector to prevent public tampering. The scope of work includes the installation of five lift station disconnect enclosures, with locations specified on Sheet A-B-01. Additionally, a fence is to be constructed around the tank area, with location and details provided on Sheet AP-D-24.G2. Another significant change involves the revision of lighting along the pathway south of the tanks, where existing bollard lights are to be replaced with S24 fixtures, utilizing repurposed existing power feeds.

The document emphasizes that this SI will be incorporated into the Contract Documents and will take precedence over any previous instructions or communications. It is the contractor's responsibility to inform all subcontractors of the changes in drawings and specifications. Importantly, the SI specifies that the work should proceed without any changes to the Contract Sum or Contract Time. The contractor's compliance with these instructions signifies their acknowledgment that there will be no financial or schedule adjustments. However, if any changes that could affect the Contract Sum or Contract Time are noted, the contractor must notify the Owner and Architect in writing before commencing the relevant work.

The document also includes a list of attachments that provide further details on the instructions. These attachments are titled A-B-01_SI-186.pdf, A-B-02_SI-186.pdf, and AP-D-24.G2_SI-186.pdf, all dated May 17, 2021. Copies of the document have been distributed to Darren Lombardi from Microsoft and Sam Nunes from WRNS Studio.

In summary, this document serves as a formal communication to ensure that all parties involved in the construction project are aware of and adhere to the updated design and security requirements without affecting the project's budget or timeline.",,correspondence,"Supplemental  Instruction  Transmittal DATE: 5/17/2021 ID: 20373 Page 2 of 2NAME COMPANY EMAIL PHONE Management, Inc.

This plan, dated August 7, 2017, is designed to support the redevelopment efforts managed by OAC Services Inc. The SMP outlines the soil management practices and procedures that will be implemented during the redevelopment of the site, based on environmental investigations conducted from January 2015 to June 2017.

The primary objective of the SMP is to address site conditions related to past property use and to manage excavation activities that aim to mitigate existing soil impacts in the subsurface. The plan is crucial for ensuring that development activities do not pose risks to the environment or to the health and safety of on-site construction workers, pedestrians, site visitors, and off-site receptors. The document details various soil management activities such as shoring, soil excavation and off-site disposal, and soil handling and grading.

The redevelopment project involves both renovation and new construction. Specifically, Buildings 2 and 5 on the site will undergo minor structural modifications without additional loads on the footings. Conversely, Buildings 1, 3, and 4 are slated for demolition. The new construction plans include a 2-story office building centrally located on the site, a 1- to 2-story conference center in the northwest, a 2-story technology center in the northeast, and a 3-story post-tensioned concrete parking garage in the southeast. Additionally, the redevelopment will feature a new entry roadway, site flatwork, and landscaping. The expected maximum excavation depth for these activities is approximately three feet.

The SMP provides a comprehensive framework for managing soil-related challenges during the redevelopment process. It ensures compliance with environmental safety standards and mitigates potential exposure to hazardous substances. The plan is a critical component of the redevelopment project, facilitating a safe and environmentally responsible transformation of the Microsoft Campus site.",,testing-inspection,"Soil Management Plan   Microsoft Campus   1045, 1055, 1065, 1075, and 1085 La Avenida Street   Mountain View, California  7 August 2017   731676204   Page 1        SOIL MANAGEMENT PLAN   Microsoft Campus  Redevelopment   1045, 1055, 1065, 1075, and 1085 La Avenida Street   Mountain View, California   1.0 INTRODUCTION   Langan Engineering and Environmental Services, Inc.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
Langan Engineering and Environmental Services, Inc. (Langan) has prepared this Soil
Management Plan (SMP) on behalf of OAC Services Inc. (the Client), in support of the
Microsoft Campus redevelopment project located at 1045, 1055, 1065, 1075, and 1085 (1045-
1085) La Avenida Street (site) in Mountain View, California (Figure 1). This SMP presents a
summary of the proposed redevelopment project, a brief site history, and soil management
practices and procedures to be employed during site redevelopment. Soil management
practices and procedures are based on the results of environmental investigations conducted at
the site between January 2015 and June 2017.
The purpose of this SMP is to describe site conditions associated with past property use and
specifically proposed excavation activities to mitigate soil impacts currently present in the
subsurface at the site. The SMP also describes measures that will be implemented during
development activities to mitigate potential risks to the environment and to protect on-site
construction workers and/or pedestrians, site visitors, and off-site receptors from potential
exposure to hazardous substances present at the site. Site development activities related to
soil impacts may include, but are not limited to, shoring, soil excavation and off-site disposal,
and soil handling and grading activities.
Current development plans for the site include a combination of renovations of existing building
and new construction. Buildings 2 and 5 will remain with minor structural modifications and no
additional loads on the footings. Building 1, 3, and 4 will be demolished. New improvements
include a 2-story office building in the middle of the site, a 1- to 2-story conference center in the
northwest part of the site, a 2-story technology center in the northeast part of the site, a 3-story
post-tensioned concrete parking garage in the southeast part of the site, new entry roadway,
site flatwork, and landscaping. A maximum excavation depth of approximately three feet is
expected at the site. A site plan showing the existing buildings and the proposed limits of new
buildings at the site is provided as Figure 2.
