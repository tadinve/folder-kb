Key features of the project include a stormwater treatment area, service yard, internal courtyard, and multiple vehicle access points. The main entry points are specified for both the office building and parking garage, with finished floor elevations provided (+30.10' for the office building and +32.60' for the parking garage).

The site plan emphasizes sustainable transportation options, including bike repair facilities, showers, and storage areas for both short-term and long-term bike parking. A proposed wetland and a fire access lane are also included, alongside shuttle bus drop-off points and main electrical switchgear installations. The plan highlights the integration of natural features such as Stevens Creek and its top of bank, as well as proposed water storage tanks and a below-grade water treatment system.

The document specifies various easements, including street, utility, and public service easements, as well as maintenance and temporary construction easements. These are crucial for ensuring access and compliance with local regulations. Additionally, the plan includes provisions for future connections to the Stevens Creek Trail, which will be addressed in subsequent filings.

The project incorporates multiple environmental and aesthetic features, such as wet meadows, willow groves, and natural ventilation areas. There are also designated open spaces, including a 60' mall open space and a pedestrian triangle of safety. The plan calls for the preservation of existing trees and the implementation of new landscaping elements, as detailed in the landscape drawings.

Accessibility is a significant focus, with detailed notes on walkways, sidewalks, and ramps to ensure compliance with accessibility standards. The plan outlines requirements for accessible parking, including van-accessible spaces and electric vehicle charging stations, adhering to California Building Code (CBC) and CALGreen standards.

Signage is another critical aspect, with various directional and identification signs approved by the planning department. These include monument signs for campus identification and visitor vehicular entrances. The document also specifies the use of wood screen enclosures, concrete screen walls, and low concrete site walls with seating to enhance the site's functionality and aesthetics.

Overall, the document provides a detailed blueprint for the development of a multi-functional site that prioritizes sustainability, accessibility, and integration with the surrounding environment. The project aims to meet regulatory requirements while offering a comprehensive infrastructure that supports various modes of transportation and enhances the site's ecological and aesthetic value.",,,"CCCCCCCC CCCCCCStandard : 6Area : 1451961.73VANVAN VAN VAN VAN NNNN 18U 1 1' 1' A"" 1""L' STORMWATER TREATMENT AREA, SCD SERVICE YARDINTERNAL COURTYARD, TYP GARAGE ENTRYVEHICLE ACCESSVEHICLE ACCESS ENTRYMAIN  ENTRY ENTRYMALL OFFICE  BUILDING F.F. +30.10' PARKING  GARAGE F.F. +32.60'EAST GARDEN PROPERTY LINEPROPERTY LINE PROPERTY LINEPROPERTY LINEBIKE REPAIRBIKE SHOWERSEMPLOYEE BIKE ENTRY PROPOSED WETLAND, SLDBIKE ROOM STORAGE PROPOSED FIRE ACCESS LANE, SCDSHUTTLE BUS  DROP-OFF MAIN ELECTRICAL SWITCHGEAR,  SCD AND SED APPROXIMATE STEVENS CREEK TOP OF BANK36 SHORT TERM BIKE STORAGE, SLD FACILITY STORAGE WATER STORAGE TANKS IN BERM, SCD12 SHORT TERM BIKE STORAGE, SLDPROPOSED BACK OF SIDEWALK ENTRYLINE OF PV ARRAY AT ROOF MAIN  ENTRY STEVENS CREEK HOZLA AVENIDA MACON AVENUEHIGHWAY 101PROJECT WORKPOINT COURTYARDCOURTYARDCOURTYARDWET MEADOWWILLOW GROVE WET MEADOW OFFICE  COURYARD TYPICAL COURTYARD WILLOW GROVE WET MEADOW18 SHORT TERM BIKE STORAGE, SLD PLAYING FIELD NATURAL VENTILATION AREAWAYS",[pdf2markdown not installed]
